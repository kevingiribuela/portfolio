# Welcome to the Verilog section!
I'm glad you came here. Verilog was the first HDL (Hardware Description Language) that I learned. 

It happened while studying a postgraduate course named "*Dise√±o Digital Avanzado*" (DDA)

Nowadays, with all the experience acquire while working on my actual company, I developed certain kind of prefference for SystemVerilog instead of Verilog since their incredible power for testing.

## What is in here? 
Here you can find differents projects that I made to succes in the DDA postgraduate course.

That's why you may see folders named by "TPx" where *x* reffers to the practice number of the course.
